## Double Linked Lists, Queue, Deque(Double Ended Queue)
	- this is just to practice classes, templates and all learned in C++ and OOP so far.
### Double Linked List:
	- It is what it is, got two pointers for each node, two pointers for efficient manipulation front and rear and a couple of methods in the class as you need.
### Queue
	- You add the the elements in the front and you take off the rear.
		- Same as double linked list but there is no addBack method.
